# Horiseon-upgradation

Refactoring code to add accessibility

## Description

I refactor the original codebase that it follows accesibility standards. 
I changed all non-semantic to semantic HTML elements.
I added `alt` attributes to all image elements.
Also, I changed title to more descriptive version.
